#AN EXPLANATION ON HOW CONVERTION FOR BLLIPPARSER TO PYTHON3 WAS DONE#

Downloaded source containing setup.py for bllipparser
Converted all *.py files to python3 with 2to3
did setup -> only with extensions for python
Copied generated .so files (Charniak and Johnson) to new python files
Checked that everything is converted to python3
downloaded fitting model
successfully tried for 1-best parsing

In RerankingParser.py, the following change was made to support 1-best parsing:
        try:
            parses = parser.parse(sentence.sentrep)
        except RuntimeError:
            parses = []
        #nbest_list = NBestList(sentence, parses, sentence_id)
        #if rerank:
        #    nbest_list.rerank(self)
        #return nbest_list
        return parses

Function call for bllipparser python3:
>>> from bllipparser_python3 import *
>>> rrp = RerankingParser.from_unified_model_dir('/somedirectory/models/WSJ/')
>>> sentence = rrp.parse('﻿To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman.')[0][1]
>>> print(sentence)
(S1 (S (NP (NP (NNP ﻿To) (NNP Sherlock) (NNP Holmes)) (NP (PRP she))) (VP (VBZ is) (ADVP (RB always)) (NP (DT THE) (NN woman))) (. .)))
>>>

Fiddled with return states and checked that you get string or list object for iteration over top parsed sentences.

#QUICK AND DIRTY!!#
